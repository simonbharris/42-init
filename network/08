# Can do a whois slash16.org and get some information that might be helpful
# to finding the host of the web server.

# the name server: ...awsdns... indicates that this is an amazon-hosted
# service (doing some research on google to find that deduction.)

# Furthermore online resources can help to speed this method up, such as
# https://www.whoishostingthis.com/

# Which returns Amazon.com
